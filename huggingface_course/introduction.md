# Model Context Protocol

MCP enables AI models to connect with external data sources, tools, and environments, allowing for the seamless transfer of information and capabilities between AI systems and the broader digital world. 

This interoperability is crucial for the growth and adoption of truly useful AI applications.

MCP offers a consistent protocol for linking AI models to external capabilities. This standardization benefits the entire ecosystem:

- users enjoy simpler and more consistent experiences across AI applications
- AI application developers gain easy integration with a growing ecosystem of tools and data sources
- tool and data providers need only create a single implementation that works with multiple AI applications
- the broader ecosystem benefits from increased interoperability, innovation, and reduced fragmentation

# The Integration Problem
The **M×N Integration Problem** refers to the challenge of connecting M different AI applications to N different external tools or data sources without a standardized approach.

### Without MCP (M×N Problem)
Without a protocol like MCP, developers would need to create M×N custom integrations—one for each possible pairing of an AI application with an external capability.

Each AI application would need to integrate with each tool/data source individually. This is a very complex and expensive process which introduces a lot of friction for developers, and high maintenance costs.

Once we have multiple models and multiple tools, the number of integrations becomes too large to manage, each with its own unique interface.

### With MCP (M+N Solution)
MCP transforms this into an M+N problem by providing a standard interface: each AI application implements the client side of MCP once, and each tool/data source implements the server side once. 

This dramatically reduces integration complexity and maintenance burden.

## Components

- **Host:** The user-facing AI application that end-users interact with directly. Examples include Anthropic’s Claude Desktop, AI-enhanced IDEs like Cursor, inference libraries like Hugging Face Python SDK, or custom applications built in libraries like LangChain or smolagents. Hosts initiate connections to MCP Servers and orchestrate the overall flow between user requests, LLM processing, and external tools.

- **Client:** A component within the host application that manages communication with a specific MCP Server. Each Client maintains a 1:1 connection with a single Server, handling the protocol-level details of MCP communication and acting as an intermediary between the Host’s logic and the external Server.

- **Server:** An external program or service that exposes capabilities (Tools, Resources, Prompts) via the MCP protocol.
